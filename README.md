### One stop shop for your four-legged friends
 This is an app that creates a platform for a community of pet lovers to interact.

 - You can find the purrfect pet for you through the petfinder adoption search
 - If you have a pet and you want to go away for the weekend you can find a pet sitter in your area through our pet sitter search
 - If you want to sign up to become a pet sitter and make some extra spending money then you can sign up.  Other users will be able to view your profile and hire you.
 - If you have an item that you want to sell or give away-- Add it to the posting board so other users can view your item
 - If you want to meet up with other pet owners and go to the dog park (*after Covid is no longer a thread of course*) create an event and add it to the posting board
